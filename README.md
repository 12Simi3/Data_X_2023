The goal of this project is to evaluate penguin species using machine learning methods.
In this project, the Penguin dataset is used: The new Iris, which will be used to create a model that will predict what species the penguin is classified as. 

## How to Install and Run the Project
### Virtual environment
At first, create a new enviroment using version Python  `Python 3.9.13`.

```bash
conda create -n yourenv python=3.9.13
```
Next, activate your virtual environment.

```bash
conda activate yourenv
```
Afterwards, it is essential to install all packages required for this project.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Loading a model
For loading the model of logistic regression use instruction file in Models directory. For loading our models we are using tensorflow library.
